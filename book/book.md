How to learn coding and find a well-paid job in IT?

In 2016 wrote a book about finding a job - preparing for interview, tweaking the CV - and the most common question I got - how do I learn to code in the first place? 

I have lifetime of experience working with computers and your way of learning will differ from mine - technology has moved forward. There are plenty of resources available - some of them are free, in reality you should invest in finding quality ones.

# Look no further: Rob Percival

Experience.
Professionalism.
Second Edition.

Save your energy on actually doing stuff, rather than hesitating (paradox of choice) which course to choose.

And if you stop reading this book in favour of doing the actual course - well done to you. Actions speak louder than words, you've chosen rightly.

(...you can always resume couple weeks later, once the course is completed)

By doing the course you'll see what is it like to solve actual technical problems. You'll also see what skills and qualities are practical in the job as a programmer.

There is no secret to programming - the best programmers I know encounter roadblocks in their work - they have experience, knowledge, tools, process allowing them to handle them more officienly.

The prices are so low it would be unfair to drive them any further, so now it's complete no-brainer.

He has released a series of courses - choose the one that you find most appealing. Just don't choose iOS if you don't have an iPhone - that would make your workflow somehow complicated.

==============================
### SIDENOTE
In the past couple of years there is market demand for IT workers. Government is constantly annoncing  need for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduades and top companies are competing for scarce talent.

Back in 2005, when I was choosing my university the situation was the similar. I invested 5 years of my life into a Computer Science degree and from the time perspective I still have no idea if that was the right choice.

To be precise - it's more than 5 years. Once you have a degree it's typical to start working in field of study to recoup the investment. Fast forward a few years, a few promotions, a few new jobs - now I'm at "six figure" level and moving on has never been more difficult.

========================================
### SIDE NOTE
Back in a day my father, university lecturer with PhD title was earning $10 (ten US dollars) per month. There were no passports, noone could leave the country (only those brave refugees who were claiming political asylum in other places). I was born in 1986, the communism fell in 1989 (many consider Berlin Wall as a symbol). I don't remember these times - food rationing and empty shelves in the shops... Some people made a lot of money during the transformation - mostly those related to previous government, communist party and secret service. I'm the first generation who has the privilege to live in a free world.

========================================
### SIDENOTE
I was searching for a job many times - my attitude towards work got me fired - but because I knew how to navigate the process of finding jobs and my skills were in demand - I was always re-hired. Sometimes it required tweaking my CV and telling a convincing story. Never really understood the concept of "permament" employment... What does it mean? There are some universal laws - intention, karma, gravity - but in a free market economy where goal of a business is to make money - to call employment "permanent" is a major misconception, a strangle linguistical concept.

("permanent" in my language means 1 month notice period")

The book about finding jobs was an attempt of "content marketing" for the recruitment agency but I didn't succeed in that venture. "Easy money" with no higher purpose... Does not work in my reality.

Currently I'm focusing on the ASTRALSHIP - this is the best outlet for my time, money and energy now right. It will be never finished - it will be always "work in progress" - the sheer joy and energy coming from working on the chapel - IMMENSE. We own a church from 1838 into a visionary space to realise human potential and heal the planet. As much as possible we will avoid employees (employee mentality sucks) - only committed supporters, partners, collaborators compensated partially with equity. Go to our website, by the time you read this words we should be sailing!

While I'm focusing on the ASTRALSHIP, I want to get this piece of writting out of the door - done is better than perfect. I have a deep core belief that I can add a lot of value. If I dedicate some hours towards creating and promoting this publication and someone becomes a successful programmer - that's 8 hours per day multiplied by weeks, months and years - it means that I did something right.

# What is your main motivation?

That's a million dollar question - what is your main motivation of learning to code? Some options immediately come to mind:
* to find a job as programmer
* to build your own startup
* to use programming skills in your current role (becoming super efficient)

The good news is - you can perform some tasks without learning how to code. There is a number of services that will give you superpowers right off the bat:

#### IFTTT, Zapier

Connecting various services together. If a new submission to the form then send the email. If new email with attachment save it to the Dropbox. Ever expanding list of services and potential combinations.

#### Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Forms
I just had a meeting with a lawyer and showed him option to share his documents with the clients, even when they do not have Google account. "Anyone with the link can view" - easy win. Efficiently managing your files, having access from any location, ability to manage permissions, searching across all documents. I don't have Word on my computer, even if someone sends me .doc or .docx I open in Google Docs.

(don't worry about privacy - Google is like oxygen - the most powerful company on the planet - they have a lot of reputation to lose - they are not interested in your meeting notes)

#### Excel
Google Sheets, Open Office, any other product of this kind. Input numbers, apply some built-in functions, generate good looking charts. No programming skills required.

#### Slack
Communication in the team. Super efficient, super popular, one of the fastest companies to achieve billion dollar valuation.

#### Trello
Super simple task management. Have a few lists (ie. todo, doing, done) and drag tasks between them. Versatile - practical for all sorts of projects - even as a personal TODO list. 

#### Basecamp, Asana, Jira
More advanced task management. There are so many project management tools, it just blews my mind. As if every software company wanted to reinveny the wheel and build their own. Eventually some leaders emerge and I'm naming just a few notable ones. Pick and choose your favourite ones.

#### Various tools
There are many tools that for free (or $5 a month) do exactly what you want try to achieve. Sometimes ability to use proper search query or knowing where to ask (Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter)

* Extracting (scraping) data from websites via import.io
* Marketing automation + Newsletters + Follow up emails
* Scheduling posts on social media via Buffer

## Why everyone should be technical?

Sprinkling some programming knowledge over traditional problems gives you an edge. Even knowing some programming terms allows you to better communicate with technical people. There is a number of freelancers who charge in region $10 per hour and eager (on fire) to find new clients.

**Programming yes, becoming full-time programmer maybe?**

I guess that's not what you wanted to hear - me encouraging you to mantain your current profession and become super efficient at what you do.
If you want to find a job a computer programmer only because it pays well - I'm not convinced if that is the best idea. If you are technical with a flair fo computers - go for it, however if your main motivation is to find a job - my genuine recommendation is beocome better with tehcnology and use it will at your current endeavours.

<< Free code bootcamp >>

********************************

## Technology Choice

I work as web developer so I might be biased here - JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Working on the web is a visually pleasing experience - you can see the buttons, forms, images - website is forming into shape.

Is also has an immediate reward and tight feedback loop - it's easy to tell if something is working or not.

Save the file - autoreload - next second I see updated version on the screen, give or take a few clicks to navigate to previous state of the app.

When I was working with the command - black screen and blobs of text - it was more difficult to establish whether some code I wrote is working or not.

I highly encourage you to have some visual result of your work, an easy way to tell if your code is working or not.

Programming can often be frustrating and to persevere you need to have many wins during the day.


### Python
Another good choice is Python - easy to learn and widely supported.

The dealbreaker about JavaScript - it is used on the web. You already have the device capable of running JavaScript out of the box - no need to install anything - if you are able to read this book, you already have a web browser.

### Become independent

Choose the line of work that suits your lifestyle.

My way of thinking - to do things independently. You probably saw some pictures of guys sitting on the beach with their laptop... If your skills are valuable only as part of a larger team - Project Manager, Business Analyst - then it will be difficult to become independent. Web development is different - pretty much every business and every person requires an online presence in one shape or another. There is a demand for web development services and there is a chance you'll find a job. If finding regular job is not something for you - you'll be able to work on freelance basis with your selected clients.

There are many technical areas that require different mindset - such as testing, database design, system administration, white hat hacking. My feeling is that web is most versatile and super easy to get started - if you have a computer then you have already have text editor and a browser. You can always build the expertise in the surrounding areas and web development is always a good start.

I challenge you to become independent - of course at some point you'll be dependent on your customers but the point still stands - to be able to deliver something from start to finish. It doesn't have to be next Mona Lisa, something "good enough" is good enough. To be independent and be able to do stuff without communication overhead, waiting for other people, not to mention hiring other people - massive plus.

I suggest you have a look at Firebase. I started using them back in 2013 while they were still in private beta - they were sponsoring a hackathon (weekend event dedicated where designers and developers build stuff). In 2016 they were acquired by Google which means "we are here to stay", you can rely on them as stable platform.

<<< Facebook Break Fast and Stable Infra>>>

Knowing a little bit of everyting (full stack) will give you a competetive edge, now you are able to delived project from start to finish and bedome independent. 

## Set your mind on a  project
(could be realistic or not)

Universe rewards brawery, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_favours_the_bold

The best project is one that is slighly beyond your current level of ability - outside of your comfort zone - but not completely impossible. Self-driving car - maybe not just yet. Robot following black line - more like to come to fruition.

It doesn't have to be realistic at first - soon you'll get a lot of feedback (either from people or technology itself) forcing you to re-asses, pivot, change strategy.

You might realise that some of the features are too optimistic - that you require more people and new skills - that's expected, it's all part of the learning experience.

### Exaple project: home page

I really like programming test for ThoughtWorks (well known consultancy) - create your online portfolio. It's broad, it's generic, everyone needs it. It's a good way of testing candidate abilities in multiple ways.

1) Are they creative?
2) Are they able to work without supervision?
3) To know their accomplishments

I didn't pass this test (should go extra mile, go above and beyond) this one but the experience was positive - they are specialists, they treat candidates with respect because it's never easy to hire. This might be a hint for you - market is hiring, technical skills are in high demand.

********************************

### Exaple project: first client

Just ask around. Word of mouth can go a long way. There are so many people - self-employed independent contractors who are just about to start their own thing but require a website... Because you are starting and they are starting - you can form a symbiotic relationship, a winning team - and keep the business relationship growing.

Working for free shouldn't be an option - assuming you did your homework - you are perfectly able of delivering some value. People who get stuff for free - do not appreciate it. On the other hand - people who pay - have expectations, regardless the actual monery value. Paying £100 or £1000 is categorised in the same mental category as "payment" so I encourage you to follow the following formula:
1) think about the amount that you think is on the upper side what you think is fair
2) multiply the number by two

In my career as freelance developer I didn't charge enough to my clients. And once you start with a low rate it's difficult to renegotiate.

#### Communication with client

Have in writing, standard terms, letter of intent.
- scope
- date of completion
- milestone
- assets (images, text)
- ongoing maintenance and fixes

If you have a flair for marketing these might be the source of extra income:
- submitting website to online catalogues similar to Yellow Pages
- managing social media profiles

SIDE NOTE:

I went full circle - from having clients, using that work in my portfolio, to corporate job, to building own products. Your path path probably will be different - I encourage you to take a leap of faith and starting from building your own product. A little tool that solves a problem, ideally using lean startup methodology ("Lean Startup" - book by Eric Ries). Even if the project isn't succesful, chances are you'll showcase it in your portfolio and reuse the code for other projects.

#### Test your work
It happened to me many times that it worked for me, sent it to the client and it wasn't that great. Cross-browser testing is essential.

- Chrome(most popular)
- Internet Explorer on Windows
- Safari on iOS
- Android browser 

If you don't have access to physical devices - there are online tools allowing to visit access the website "as if" from such and such mobile deveice. 

Chrome is the most popular browser.

Historically Firefox was a popular browser for developers, these days Chrome is most popular across the board.

#### Showcasing your work

Usually what I do this time is to record 1 minute walkthrough video - me showing stuff. To record 1 minute video takes exactly 1 minute, then a few seconds to upload to Youtube, set as "unlisted" and add [unlisted] in the title so your client doesn't freak out.

(of course the privacy option is indicated by an icon but not immediately obvious for everyone)

Recording short videos goes a long way. Sometimes I do it instead of writing email, maybe I should do this instead of writing this book? So here is what I do - quote me on that - and if 10 people pre-pay Kickstarter style video course based on this book I'll do it. Here is the link -  https://genesis.re/videobook - 10 payments and I'll commit.

### Code samples

Majority of the employers and recruiters ask for them and I agree to that - if I was hiring I'd always require to see code samples.

If you don't have it - start working on it - see projects above.

## Other areas of interest

There are other areas of technology that are booming right now:

#### Machine Learning and Aritficial Intelligence

I've seen the Google IO Keynote and they invest so heavily. The tool they've developed - TensorFlow - is becoming increasingly popular - it is integrated with more and more Google products.

#### VR + AR

Virtual Reality has been aroun since 80s

Dire Straits - Money For Nothing - 30 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTP2RUD_cL0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_for_Nothing_(song)#Music_video
"The groundbreaking video was the first to be aired on MTV Europe when the network launched on 1 August 1987."

****************** SIDENOTE
Now the Virtual Reality is so advanced I dare to introduce a new concept:

**Reality Check**

How can you define real?

Elon Musk discussing "base reality", sufficiently advanced civilisation could create: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8

Touring test has been passed. Now time for **Reality Check** - an experiment where test subjects observe and interact with environment and their goal is to estrablish - is it a simulation or base reality?
************************

#### Blockchain + Ethereum

Blockchain is the underlying piece of technology powering Bitcoin. Distributed ledger - exact same copy of the database stored across multitude computers on the network. Almost impossible (search for "51% attack") to tamper with - that's the biggest asset - no government, no bank, noone really can mess with it therefore it's so resilient.

Another good choice - learn smart contracts, Ethereum, Solidity... It is already happening and blockchain programmers are in high demand.

#### Data visualisation

See demos on D3 page. There is much data being generated, but how to make sense out of it? Data analysis and visualisation come to the rescue. It's logical - more data - difficult to grasp - we need tools and skillful operators using them.

********************************* RANDOM WAR STORY *****************

Currently I work in a job - highly regulated environemnt - so many different systems - granular access ("need to know" basis). Processes aren't fully automated. Even the simplest change such as changing text here or there is 15 minutes.

Sorry if I'm using difficult words:

Project management software
Source control repository.
Build + deployment.
Veryfying that fix has been applied.


15 minutes is the bare minumum, physical limit of our systems.
That was the super-simple example, usually changes are much involved and require testing.
On my best day I was able to close 4 different issues.
Small win every time - allow yourself a boost of happiness - your work is progressing.


********************************


### Frameworks, libraries

First learn the basics. Soon you'll realise there are some typical problems that are typical and have established solutions.

Sometimes I say my job is plumbing things together.

Everything has been done already, many problems has been solved. Opportunities lives on the intersection of things. Tinder for dogs - voilla! And there is the thing:
- no need to build a phone
- no need to develop fast-charging battery system
- no need to worry about WiFi congfiguration and cellurar connectivty

You take existing tools and use them. Standing on the shoulders of the giants. Use tools provided by Google, Facebook, Apple - they all work extra hard to attract developers to their ecosystem. Additional benefit of choosing your favourite platform - chances of getting hired by these companies. It's a good deal for them as well - they don't have to train you in using the internal tool - you've already proven that you are proficient.

********************************

### Tools

Every single piece of software comes with 30 days trial. Try a few and make your own opinion - see what works for you best. 

<<< XKCD configure >>>

Personally I don't like spending time configuring stuff. It should work out of the box, without fiddling in the settings. Very often I'm disappointed when some tool / framework / library does not have a working demo. It happens way too often and quite literally - I'm frustrated, I'm tired, by the time I solve the mystery I don't have much energy to use the actual product.

If it happens to you - don't worry - I've been in a similar position infinite number of times. Trying out new thing and banging head against the wall. With experience you'll learn how to troubleshoot typical problems and how to ask better questions.

Quality of the demo / tutorial / example is good estimation of quality of the product. It's the first impression that counts and good companies simply get it!

Know your toolbbox, choose a few tools and know them well

### StackOverflow
Create your profile - you'll inevitably start using this website.
Any search result for a certain coding error message will get you there.
Even Google in their official documentation is linking to StackOverflow when asking for support.
It's effectiely a "go to" place for solving technical problems.
So get your profile set up, full stop.

Hint (kind of obvious) for effective Google queries: rather then searching for "Error: calculateKittens function is undefined" remove the `calculateKittens` from the search question. Do I need to explain why? It's unlikely anyone else were to use `calculateKittens` as the function name and you will be unlikely to find an results.

#### Related topics

As you start typing your question you'll be presented with some suggestions.
As you provide more information about your problem, Stack Oveflow is smart enough to suggest some answers related to the topic.

#### Precise communication

You are describing problem to other people over the internet, in the text form - need to be precise, specific.
Soon you'll discover that in the process you are starting answering your own question.
As you start explaining what have you tried, you'll  discover "but I haven't tried that" and before posting the question you'll have a chance to discover other options.
Don't just post "here is my code, doesn't work" - mention what you have tried already what was the output - very often as you describe your attempts you'll realise some others, unexplored ways.

#### Isolated case

Don't just post 100+ lines (a few screens) of code across multiple files.
Minimise the code that is problematic.
It is another great exercise - simplifying the problem.
Sometimes there are some "unrelated" unintended consequences and by reducing the problem it may start working - then you'll be much close to find offending bits of code.

#### Rubber duck debugging

There process of talking your problem to another person - when there is no another person around - use a rubber duck instead. It's similar to StackOverflow in a way that you explain your problem in a detailed manner.

## Editor
Good editor or IDE (integrated development environment) will save you plenty of hours in the long run. Choose your weapon:
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Notepad++ (popular among old-school Windows programmers)
- WebStorm
- Visual Studio Code

All of them have plugin system - do not overconfigure stuff. Make a note "something would be useful" and when you need it for the third time - now it's time to do the time investment.

Pick one that suits you best, no good or bad answers here. Sometiems there are specific IDEs (Integrated Desktop Environments) for specific languages, such as Android Studio for Android or Visual Studio for Windows.

SIDENOTE: For many people Microsoft is associated with Windows and being an evil company. In reality they have a universe of neatly integrated services - it's not just the operating system, it's the thousands of products that run on top.

## Source control

Until you've becomme a programmer you were storing files the "regular way". In order to keep track of change in progamming projects we use source control - each change is recorded and we can restore revision from any point in time. It is extremely practical when something stops to work and you can tavel back in time to find a version that was working and find the code that is causing regression.

(further down the line you'll observe that automated test serve a safeguard role against regressions but that's slightly more advanced)

### Github:
Github is very popular but private repositories require a monthly fee. In means that only your public code can be stored for free (be cautious when storing passwords in the codebase). Other competetors occupy this niche and offer them for free private repositories: BitBucket and GitLab.

Many popular open-source projects are hosted on Github - anyone can contribute code or report an issue. It is unlikely to happen at first but as your project becomes more popular, other people start using it and help you out.

## Code samples
Practical when sharing code on StackOveflow or reporting bugs on Github:

- JSFiddle
- JsBin
- Plnkr
- Codepen

Choose the one that suits you best, the all offer comparable set of features.

## Coding challenges
If you feel competetive and want to participare in challenges here are some good links:
- InterviewStreet
- TopCoder

These days it's not only algorithmic challenges but real-life problems - some of them are submitted by reputable companies seeking to solve their problems. Great way to level up and learn from the best in business.

EAXMPLE: The other day Netflix ran $1m competition to enhance their movie recommendation algorithm. 

## Some more links that happen to stick in my mind and are worthy
- HackerX: recruitment evnets
- HackerWall: collection of handy code snippets
- AirPair: watching people coding live! 
- Dribble: for designers. Sometimes I push some pixels here and there but I'm not a designer

If you know some other good resources let me know - I'll happily update this publication.

## White hat hacking and security bounties
Pretty much every company out there offers sizeable cash payments.

# Online course on Udemy, Coursera, EdX or any other platform

See the first page.
Low risk high reward.
I highly recommend course by Rob Percival.

<<< LINK >>>

Once you are done you should be able to find your first client, find a job and / or customise one of the sample projects to serve your needs and promote it.

TRUISM: Great programmers are not always great marketeers. That is why successful companies consists of multidisciplinary teams.
HINT: My typical question during a job interview is "what is the size of technical team" - that gives me a better understanding of the company's DNA and also shows that I'm more than a coding monkey, but someone who understands the ecosystem.

# Programming Bootcamp

...if you can easily afford it. What could possibly go wrong? The reality is most of the people cannot afford thousands of dollars / pounds and several weeks out of their life.

(it's not only cost of tuition but the opportunity cost - not making money in other ways)

Some people take loans (banks, friends, family) to commence such education. It is defnitely an option - using money as a tool, as an enabler.

Personally I've never been to such facility but it seems legit - you need to do your own research. Make an effort to find a balanced opinion of all the participants - not only schools (marketing) or those who were successful in landing well paid jobs. 

Seek opinions of people who realised being a computer programmer is not their line of work.

Do your own research, don't be lured by colorful marketing.

# University

It takes too long. It's too expensive. In the UK and US it's s a costly activity - students tend to take loans so when they leave university they are in debt. Hurray! You got a degree, now you have to work to pay off your loan...

I have nothing against education and learning. You should always learn. If you really think that going to university is something you really have to do:
* Take a gap year first
* Be sure what you want to study
* Don't pay for it: scholarhips, or maybe a different country with free education? (you may need to learn the language first)

I made several mistakes in my approach to university. Probably the biggest one was sense of entitlement - because I graduated from the top degree in the top high school - I thought I'll get new jobs easily.

> Hard work beats talent, when talent doesn't work.

University could be good in terms of making friends, expanding your network but... I bet you can make friends anyway. 


Social skills, positive attitude, equally important at work.

I can tell you that some of the best programmers I know have mild spectrum of autism - asperberg syndrome. What it means in plain English - deep interest in particilar subject, being very detailed, etc... These qualities are super useful when programming so no wonder why they are so good! There is an element of social awkwardness but they cope very well, I'm often considered unconventional too and I'm reasonably open and transparent about it.


********************************

# On the job training

The best what could happen to you - to learn on the job.

In reality - even if it is entry-level, "all training provided" apprentice type of job - there will be always some entry exam / recruitment test.

So you need to know some basics anyway. Or at least show some initiative and interest. 

It should be clear, it should be obvious - as an employer I would rather hire someone who has already some skills. No such thing as free launch... I was actually a bad employee - I always saw "what's in it for me" - I should have thought more about the value I provide to the company. Too bad the incentives were not aligned  in the employment contracts - all obligations, reponsibilities and no upside potential. As an employee I couldn't escape employee mentality" - doign just enough not to get fired and not engaged

That is why in my current project (astralship.org) we don't want employees - we want to have partners, collaborators, supporters and when hiring professionals we pay 50% cash 50% equity.

# Try it first

Lifetramp. Community of people showing daily work routines to their guests. Just like Couchsurfing for work - try it before jumping head first. You may soon realise that working as computer programmer is pretty mundane job.

Paradox of choice

Mental fatigue

# Automation in agriculture

Good news is - automation is taking over - people don't have to work. See what percentage of population works in agriculture:

* in the UK - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_Kingdom - 1.5%
* in the US - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States#Employment - less than 2%
 
Nature already knows how to grow food, there is abundant energy from the Sun, and in my reality people don't have to work... It will take some time until it will happen but have a look at Universal Basic Income - the change is there...

# Truth Bombs

Bush family was doing business with Hitler?

In the era of free information such association would be seriously uncool. For some reason it didn't stop them becoming president of the United States - much respect to them!

You sure know 9/11 - some airplanes hitting some buildings that consequently fell down. Have you heard of Building 7? That is completely bonkers - please apply some critical, rational thinking.

Fluoride in the water. Pineal gland.

War on drugs + private prison system + cssh for kids scandal.

("Lowcy Skor" in Poland - selling information about deceased people to funeral homes - too bad people haven't died yet so medical stuff was feeding them with a drug causing death)

Sugar industry sponsoring research stating that fat is leading cause of obesity.

Exxon Mobil and climate denial. Shell showing education video about climate change in 1991.

Fashion Models.

Consuption, planned obsolesce.

Meat and dairy industry

Advertising of loans, debts and buying stuff that you can pay later.

# War on drugs

Develop your own judgement about mind altering substances.

Cannabis is leading the way.

Did they make drugs illegal because it can harm you?

- alcohol and tobacco widely available
- feeding animals with antibiotics
- adding sugar to so many processed foods
- fluoride in water 

See Nixon advisor:

Now there we have internet, research, data, science.

War on drugs is probaby the single biggest fuckup in the history of humanity. 

# Egoistic altruism

As with everything I could be wrong. Describing my point of view only.

Giving money to homeless is a selfish act:
* it makes me happy
* they have more money, so they can help others (including me)
* they are less likely to commit a crime

(not accusing or anything but being desperate sometimes require desperate measures - to steal a wallet might seem like an immediatete relief of financial needs but causes a lot of distress - to apply for new ID and payment cards is a serious hassle and cost much more in terms of wasted time)

# Conscious narcissism

Finding right balance - to know own self-worth. There are some physical activities:
- moutain climbing
- triathlon
- "ego eradicator" in Kundalini yoga

I'm not special by any measure. At the same I'm recognising my current state and commitment to fully realise human potential.

# Becoming vegan

Just think about it - animal agriculture - cutting rainforest to grow food for animals. It hurts me to admit that I eat eggs and beans in my work canteene. I'd love to go vegan but I don't have enough support network and the climate of the UK is not favourable. Call me a concious hypocrite and I'll love you anyway.
